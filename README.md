# what-the-pug
high fidelity html to pug conversion

ever had to transpile an html snippet from the https://angular.io or https://material.angular.io docs into pug because your project is using that?
well, i have. and the tools out there so far not only transform all attribute names to lowercase, they also severely mess up illegal attribute key characters ```[(click)]="bind much?"```

head over to https://maxwellium.github.io/what-the-pug/ to see it in action, or checkout the demo in the test folder.
